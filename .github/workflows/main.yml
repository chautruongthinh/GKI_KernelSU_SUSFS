          Please ensure you have proper backups before installation.

          🔹 Normal 
          - Default kernel configuration 
          - Standard kernel module loading behavior 
          - Recommended for most users 

          Features:
          -> Wild KSU
          -> Multi Manager Support for WKSU, KernelSU-Next! Needs Testing: KSU, MKSU RKSU, xxKSU, KowSU and SukiSU (Best compatibility with WKSU, no support will be provided for other managers)
          -> SUSFS ඞ v2.0.0
          -> Scope-Minimized Manual hooks v1.4
          -> Ptrace Patch Support for Older Kernels (<5.16)
          -> IPSet Support for Advanced Network Filtering
          -> Wireguard Support

          🔹 BBG (Baseband-guard)
          - A lightweight LSM (Linux Security Module) for Android kernel
          - Blocks unauthorized writes to critical partitions/device nodes
          - Prevents malicious tampering with baseband and boot chain
          - Kernel-level protection via LSM hooks
          - Reduces risk of soft-brick/hard-brick issues          

          Notes:
          -> SUS SU Mode 2 will show as disabled or not compatible due to non-kprobe hooks and is not needed anymore!
          -> Official Kernel Flasher is broken with latest susfs, try https://github.com/fatalcoder524/KernelFlasher/
          -> **boot.img files**: Available as CI artifacts only - download from the Actions tab in the "Misc" Artifact
          -> **Warning**: boot.img files may not boot on some devices
          -> **Note:** For detailed commit information and component versions, please check the build summary in the "Misc" Artifact
